b. Immutable ledger to maintain a tamper-proof record of invoice transactions.

c. Smart contracts to automate invoice validation, approval workflows, and dispute resolution.

d. Integration with external systems such as ERP systems to exchange relevant data.

e.  User-friendly interfaces for invoice management, reporting, and analytics.


## 3. User Roles
The product will support the following user roles:

a. Supplier: Creates and submits invoices for goods or services provided.

b. Buyer: Reviews and approves invoices, ensuring accuracy and preventing over invoicing.

c. Auditor: Monitors invoice transactions, conducts audits, and resolves disputes, if any.

## 4. Functional Requirements
### 4.1 Invoice Creation
a. Suppliers should be able to create and submit invoices, providing relevant details such as invoice ID, amount, buyer information, and invoice items.

b. The system should validate the invoice data, ensuring it meets the required format and consistency rules.

### 4.2 Invoice Approval
a. Buyers should be able to review and approve invoices based on predefined rules and criteria.

b. The system should enforce approval workflows, including multi-level approvals if necessary.

c. Approvers should have visibility into the invoice history, audit trail, and supporting documents.

### 4.3 Invoice Verification
a. The system should automatically verify invoices against purchase orders, delivery receipts, and contract terms to ensure accuracy.

b. In case of discrepancies, the system should flag the invoice for further investigation and resolution.

### 4.4 Dispute Resolution

a. The system should provide a mechanism for raising and managing invoice disputes.

b. Auditors should have the authority to review and resolve disputes, facilitating communication between buyers and suppliers.

### 4.5 Reporting and Analytics

a. The product should offer reporting and analytics capabilities to generate insights on invoice trends, discrepancies, and performance metrics.

b. Users should be able to generate customized reports and export them in various formats.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
### 5.1 Security and Privacy
a. The system should ensure data confidentiality and integrity through appropriate encryption mechanisms.

b. Access to sensitive information should be restricted based on user roles and permissions.

c. User authentication and authorization mechanisms should be implemented to control system access.

### 5.2 Performance and Scalability
a. The product should be capable of handling a large number of invoices and transactions with minimal latency.

b. The system should be scalable to accommodate increased user load and growing data volumes.

### 5.3 Integration

a. The product should integrate with external systems such as ERP systems to exchange relevant invoice and transaction data.

b. The integration should support standard data exchange formats and protocols.

### 5.4 User Experience

a. The user interfaces should be intuitive, user-friendly, and responsive.

b. The system should provide appropriate feedback and notifications to users during the invoice lifecycle.

### 5.5 Auditability

a. The system should maintain an audit trail of all invoice-related transactions, including approvals, disputes, and resolutions.

b. The audit trail should be easily accessible and tamper-proof.

### 5.6 Compliance

a. The product should adhere to relevant regulatory and compliance requirements, such as data protection and financial regulations.

## 6. Constraints and Assumptions

a. The project will leverage the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain framework.

b. The product will be developed using the Go programming language for chaincode development.

c. The deployment will be on a cloud-based infrastructure, such as AWS.

### 7. Dependencies

a. Availability of a Hyperledger Fabric network with the required network components (orderer nodes, peer nodes, etc.).

b. Integration with external systems, such as ERP systems, may require collaboration with the respective system owners.

## 8. Risks and Mitigation Strategies

a. Risks associated with data privacy and security should be mitigated through appropriate encryption and access control mechanisms.

b. Risks related to scalability and performance should be addressed through load testing and performance tuning.

## 9. Conclusion
