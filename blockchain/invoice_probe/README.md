## invoiceProbe

Over invoicing is a problem that occurs when a supplier intentionally or unintentionally inflates the amount on an invoice beyond the agreed-upon price or quantity of goods or services provided. This can lead to financial loss, inaccurate accounting, and damage to business relationships.
Hyperledger Fabric, as a blockchain framework, can help solve the over invoicing problem by providing transparency, immutability, and accountability in the invoicing process. 
#### Here's how:
#### Transparency: 
Hyperledger Fabric allows all participants in the network to have a shared view of the ledger. Each invoice transaction, including creation, approval, and verification, is recorded on the blockchain. This transparency ensures that all parties involved can access and verify the invoice details, eliminating the possibility of hidden or manipulated information.
#### Immutability: 
Once an invoice transaction is recorded on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain, it becomes immutable. This means that the data cannot be altered or tampered with without consensus from the network participants. This feature prevents unauthorized changes to invoice details and provides an auditable trail of all modifications, if any, enhancing trust and accountability.
####  Smart Contracts: 
Hyperledger Fabric supports the use of smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with predefined rules and conditions. Smart contracts can be used to automate the invoice validation and approval process. The contract can validate the invoice details against predefined business rules, such as matching the invoice with purchase orders and delivery receipts, ensuring accuracy and preventing over invoicing.
Decentralization and Consensus: Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned blockchain that requires consensus among network participants to validate and agree on transactions. This decentralized approach ensures that no single entity has control over the invoicing process. Consensus mechanisms, such as Raft or Kafka, provide a trustless environment where all participants must agree on the validity of an invoice before it is recorded on the blockchain.
#### Auditing and Dispute Resolution: 
The transparent and immutable nature of the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain enables easy auditing of invoice transactions. In case of a dispute, the blockchain can serve as an indisputable source of truth, providing a complete history of invoice events and actions taken by different parties. This can facilitate quicker and more efficient dispute resolution.
By leveraging the capabilities of Hyperledger Fabric, organizations can establish a secure and transparent invoicing system that reduces the risk of over invoicing. The distributed nature of the blockchain, coupled with smart contracts and consensus mechanisms, enhances trust, accuracy, and accountability in the invoicing process, benefiting both suppliers and buyers.
